# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation – Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on grouping customers into meaningful segments using unsupervised machine learning techniques.  
The dataset includes basic customer demographic and spending information, and all steps—from data preprocessing to segmentation visualization—are implemented in the Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 📌 Overview

The notebook covers the full ML pipeline:

- Importing and exploring the dataset  
- Handling missing values  
- Feature selection and scaling  
- Applying K-Means clustering  
- Choosing the optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method)  
- Visualizing cluster groups  
- Interpreting customer segments  

---

## 📂 Project Files

- **customer segmentation.ipynb** — Contains the entire workflow including preprocessing, clustering, and visualizations.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**

## ▶ How to Run the Project

1. **Install required libraries**:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

jupyter notebook "customer segmentation.ipynb"


3. **Run all the cells to reproduce the clustering results.**

**📈 Results**

- The notebook generates:

- Cleaned and scaled dataset

- K-Means clustering model

- Elbow curve to determine optimal cluster count

- Visualizations such as:

- Cluster scatter plots

- Distribution of customers within each segment

**These results help identify customer groups based on behavior and demographics.**

---

**🎯 Goal of the Project**

- To learn and demonstrate:

- Data preprocessing for clustering

- Feature scaling

- Implementing K-Means clustering

- Using the Elbow Method

- Visualizing and interpreting cluster groups
